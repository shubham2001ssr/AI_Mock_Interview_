# Abstract

InterviewGenie is an AI‑driven interview preparation platform that simulates realistic mock interviews using ElevenLabs voice agents. It supports both **Business (MBA)** and **Technical (CS)** tracks, dynamically generating tailored questions based on selected focus areas, role, and experience level. The system records the conversation, evaluates performance across multiple dimensions, and surfaces curated learning resources to help users improve.

# Problem Statement

Preparing for job interviews is time‑consuming and often lacks personalized feedback. Candidates need a solution that:

- Generates role‑specific, track‑appropriate interview questions on demand.
- Provides an interactive, voice‑based interview experience that mimics real‑world conversations.
- Offers immediate, structured feedback on communication, technical knowledge, problem‑solving, and cultural fit.
- Connects users to relevant learning resources for targeted skill development.

InterviewGenie addresses these gaps by combining AI‑generated interview flows, real‑time voice interaction, and automated feedback, delivering a comprehensive, self‑paced interview practice environment.
